    Random intercepts Poisson regression with fixed slopes.  Each group has its own random intercept (alpha_g), while slopes may be homogeneous (shared across groups) or heterogeneous (group-specific), but are treated as fixed effects. Marginal group rates are computed by integrating over the random intercept and the covariate distribution.
